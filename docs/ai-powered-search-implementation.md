   - Active tools display with visual indicators
   - Enhanced dropdown with active state indicators

## AI Query Generation Process

### 1. System Prompt for AI Query Generator
```
You are an expert web search query strategist. Your task is to generate multiple sophisticated search queries that will comprehensively research a given topic.

Guidelines:
- Create diverse search queries approaching the topic from different angles
- Include specific, targeted queries rather than broad ones
- Consider current events for time-sensitive topics
- Include fact-checking queries for controversial topics
- Add technical/detailed queries for complex subjects
- Consider comparative queries if multiple options exist
```

### 2. Response Format
The AI returns structured JSON:
```json
{
  "rationale": "Brief explanation of the search strategy",
  "queries": [
    {
      "query": "specific search query text",
      "rationale": "why this query is important for comprehensive research"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Example AI-Generated Queries
For topic: "latest developments in artificial intelligence 2024"

Generated queries might include:
- "artificial intelligence breakthroughs 2024 latest research" (recent developments)
- "AI safety concerns regulations 2024" (safety and policy angle)
- "GPT-4 Claude Gemini comparison 2024" (competitive landscape)

## Search Execution Flow

1. **User Input**: User enables "Search the web" tool and submits query
2. **AI Query Generation**: System generates 3 specialized search queries with rationales
3. **Parallel Search**: All queries executed simultaneously
4. **Result Aggregation**: Results combined with query context
5. **AI Analysis**: Main AI analyzes comprehensive results for final response

## Enhanced Result Format

The AI receives search results in this enhanced format:

```
SEARCH_QUERY: [original user query]

Search Strategy: [AI-generated strategy rationale]

Search Queries Generated:
1. "[query 1]" - [rationale 1]
2. "[query 2]" - [rationale 2]
3. "[query 3]" - [rationale 3]

Results for Query 1: "[query 1]"
1.1. [Result title]
     [Result description]
     Source: [URL]

[Similar format for other queries]

Research Summary:
- Total Results: X
- Unique Sources: Y
- Queries Executed: Z
```

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### AI Query Generation Failures
- **Fallback**: Automatic switch to heuristic query generation
- **Continuation**: Search process continues even if AI generation fails
- **User Feedback**: Toast notification explains fallback usage

### Search Execution Failures
- **Partial Failures**: Continue with successful queries if some fail
- **Complete Failure**: Graceful degradation to general knowledge response
- **Error Messages**: Clear user feedback with technical details

### API Response Parsing
- **JSON Validation**: Strict validation of AI response structure
- **Content Extraction**: Attempts to extract JSON from wrapped responses
- **Quality Checks**: Ensures queries have both text and rationale

## User Interface Enhancements

### Toast Notifications
1. "Generating search strategy..." - AI creating queries
2. "Executing search queries..." - Running searches
3. "Research completed" - Success with result summary
4. "Search failed" - Error with fallback explanation

### Active Tools Display
- Visual pill badges showing enabled tools
- Icons for each tool type (Search, Brain, etc.)
- X buttons for easy tool removal
- Green dot indicators in dropdown menu

## Benefits of AI-Powered Search

### Compared to Simple Search:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple angles vs. single query
- **Strategic Approach**: AI understands research methodology
- **Specialized Queries**: Targeted searches for different aspects
- **Better Source Diversity**: Multiple query types find varied sources
- **Context Awareness**: AI considers time sensitivity and topic complexity

### User Experience:
- **Transparency**: Users see the search strategy and rationale
- **Confidence**: Comprehensive approach builds trust in results
- **Education**: Users learn about effective search strategies
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms ensure consistent functionality

## Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage:
- AI query generation with various topic types
- Fallback to heuristic generation
- Error handling for API failures
- Result formatting and parsing
- User interface interactions

### Performance Considerations:
- Parallel query execution for speed
- Reasonable query limits (3 queries default)
- Timeout handling for slow responses
- Efficient result aggregation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
- Query refinement based on initial results
- User feedback on query quality
- Custom query count selection
- Domain-specific query strategies
- Result ranking and relevance scoring

### Scalability:
- Query caching for common topics
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Result caching for repeated searches
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Configuration

### Default Settings:
- **Max Queries**: 3 per search session
- **AI Model**: 'AI4Chat/default'
- **Search Engine**: DuckDuckGo
- **Max Results**: 5 per query
- **Timeout**: Standard API timeout

### Customization Options:
- Query count can be adjusted in `comprehensiveSearch()` calls
- Search engine can be changed in search options
- AI model can be modified in `generateQueriesWithAI()`
- Result limits configurable per search engine

## Conclusion

The AI-powered web search implementation represents a significant advancement in research capabilities, transforming PyscoutAI from a simple chatbot into a sophisticated research assistant. The system provides comprehensive, strategic search capabilities while maintaining reliability through robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

This implementation sets the foundation for advanced research features and demonstrates the power of AI-assisted information retrieval in modern chat applications.
